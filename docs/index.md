# CoReason Economist

**Domain:** Economic Metareasoning & Resource Optimization
**Scientific Basis:** Rational Metareasoning, Value of Computation (VOC), & Bounded Rationality
**Architectural Role:** The Cognitive "CFO" and Optimization Engine

## Executive Summary

`coreason-economist` is the central banking and resource allocation authority of the CoReason platform. While `coreason-cortex` decides *how* to think, `coreason-economist` decides *if it is worth* thinking.

In an ecosystem where every "thought" (token) has a real-world cost (financial and temporal), this package prevents "Cognitive Sprawl"—the tendency of agents to enter infinite reasoning loops or use overpowered models for trivial tasks. It implements a strict **Return on Investment (ROI)** philosophy, ensuring that the utility of the generated intelligence exceeds the cost of its production.

## Functional Philosophy

The agent must implement the **Resource-Rational Control Loop**:

1.  **Estimation before Execution:** No process (System 2, Council, Tool Call) runs without a pre-computed cost estimate.
2.  **Value of Computation (VOC):** The system must continuously evaluate if the *next* step of reasoning is likely to change the outcome enough to justify its cost.
3.  **Token Arbitrage:** Given a set of requirements, the system should always recommend the cheapest model that satisfies the minimum quality threshold.
4.  **Sunk Cost Awareness:** The system must be willing to terminate a "bad line of thought" immediately, regardless of how much has already been spent.
